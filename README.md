Our Discord Travel Therapy Bot aims to help Torontonians in their daily life by recommending different places around the city based on their current mental state. Our app strives to counter negative emotions by recommending tailored destinations for people to explore that can help people feel better.

Our discord bot mainly uses Python to develop the backend system of our bot, and with the help of the discord API, our bot provides a user-friendly and understandable interface. After getting input from users, our app uses Co:here to generate recommendations based on the emotions displayed by the user.
